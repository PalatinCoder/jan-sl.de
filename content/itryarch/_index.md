On a rainy sunday afternoon I felt the sudden urge to ditch Windows as my desktop OS and replace it with some Linux distro.
At the same time, I felt the need to start a blog about it: This is the result of that thought. Start with the [Pilot] if you want the full experience :wink:

Don't expect it to be some sort of guide or even tutorial.
It rather is like a diary of me struggling to get some things working ðŸ˜„
