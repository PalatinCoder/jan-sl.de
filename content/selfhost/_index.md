Just how much services can an Atom C3558 hold? Let's find out!

The core of my homelab is an Intel Atom C3558 on a Supermicro A2SDi-4C-HLN4F with currently 16GB of finest registered ECC RAM.
It lives inside an Inter-Tech 2U-2404S which is a 2U 19" format case that I put in a Lack Rack under my desk, accompanied by my Fritz!Box 7530, a TL-SG1016DE and a patch panel.

On the server, I run some useful services for me, but I'm also hosting some public facing services on some VPSes.
The posts in this section will be mostly about how I setup my infrastructure in my (home)lab to run these services.
